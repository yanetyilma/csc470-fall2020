# Final: Babysitting Rush!

I am planning on making a babysitting game. There will be an option to select which sister you would want to play as. They both have the same stats so you just choose whichever you want. Both sister will be babysitting, yet you will be one of them. The other unselected sister would be autonomous so you have to be quicker than her to do tasks or else she gets all the credit! There is a child that you have to feed, bathe, play with, etc. Doing the tasks before the other sister will help you gain points. The baby has needs that go down as time goes by. The quicker you grab the task the more points you get. The father will come back when the timer reaches three minutes. Whichever sister has the most points, the father will pay and will ask to babysit again!

I want to have a very colorful game aesthetic with lots of neon colors like pink, cyan, purple, green, etc. I want it to seem fun and lively.

Furthermore, I want to have an audio style similar to the Hotline Miami video game so mainly like alternative and retro 80's music in the background. Some examples could be like Perturbator, MOON, El Huervo, etc. Upbeat retro techno music basically.

I'm going to download characters and objects needed for this project from poly.Google.com and build the house and settings most likely from probuilder on Unity.

I plan on having a title page and a how to play to allow the player to understand what they are playing and how to do so. For the mechanics portion of the game, to make the unselected sister autonomous, I will apply that when "said" amount of seconds pass, the sister will do the task. So for example, for one task the unselected sister will automatically do the task after ".05" seconds and the player would probably not press the button to do that task in time, which lets the unselected sister get the points since she was too quick this time. I'm not sure what time stamps I want to give the unselected sister just yet but I know that I want her to do some tasks quicker and slower than the selected sister so the points are pretty close. Also, I will have an intro scene where the father will speak to both sisters and tell them what they need to do before he comes back. I will use raycasting as well to click on items that correlate with said task. Also, there will be a countdown timer using floats and Time.delta.Time and much more. Furthermore, the baby will have needs that will decay as the clock goes down so you would need to see what needs to be done. I'm aiming to make the baby's needs from green(good) to red(bad) similar to the Sims 4 when they have decaying needs. That will probably be done using the examples used for meters in class and UI.

The "low bar" will be the same introduction as planned but the game probably wouldnt be as interactive just mainly clicking UI and making the needs of the baby go up while gaining points. It just wouldnt be as fancy like the needs would just be green even if the babys needs are low. Also, the unselected sister will have a default time for each task so the player would either mainly get the tasks or not. 

Since this is due December 10th, I want to be done by the 5-6th so I can have time to change a few things to make it fit what I have planned exactly.

The "high bar" would probably be what my original plan but much more interactive like scenes that show the player doing the task like not animated but more like collecting food from a table and giving it to the baby. Other from that, I would be satisfied with my original plans.

I plan on getting all the necessary OBJ's by the end of the day 11/24 so I can quickly get started on the setting of the game which I want to make very detailed. I really like aesthetics when it comes to games so I want to make sure it looks visually appealing at most. Since the core mechanic of the game is due 11/30, I want to get a nice rough draft by then so I can further make another draft(more developed) by 12/5-6. Hopefully by the 10th I can have a nice polished version of my drafts that visually match what I plan on achieving.
